* 
* This class creates the board for the Connect Four game, 
* it stores the number of pieces in plays, 
* sets all pieces on board, 
* takes user's input to place a new piece on the board, 
* checks if there is a winning set of pieces on the board, 
* if the board is full so no other pieces can be played and 
* can return all the piece positions on the board.
