 *  @brief This class is responsible for defining a player
 *
 *  The Player superclass defines a player. Each player will have a name,
 *  score, and colour. There is no setName or setColour method as once a player is 
 *  defined you do not need to change their name or colour. The player will need to 
 *  collaborate with the game through the move method where it will take input 
 * (from either the user or a computer-generated move); the move method is abstract,
 * as each type of player will have a different algorithm for deciding a move.
