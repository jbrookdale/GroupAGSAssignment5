* @brief This creates the abstract class GUI 
* 		 which will be extended by the other GUI classes.
* 
* This class is an abstract class to be inherited by subclasses of the GUI,
* it has the methods of setting title, height and width of the window, 
* it takes the three variables for these methods as input in the constructor.
