* This class will lay down the foundations for the subclasses which creates
* the board behind the GUI, this will check if the board is full or places a 
* piece on the board or increases the players piece count or returns the players
* piece count. In this class, they are abstract methods which means that the 
* subclasses implement the methods shown.
